% \section{Seizure Activity (16 pts)} 
% The dataset \texttt{I521\_A0001\_D002} contains an example of human intracranial EEG (iEEG) data displaying seizure activity. It is recorded from a single channel (2 electrode contacts) implanted in the hippocampus of a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy being evaluated for surgery. In these patients, brain tissue where seizures are seen is often resected. You will do multiple comparisons with this iEEG data and the unit activity that you worked with in Homework 0 \texttt{(I521\_A0001\_D001)}. You will have to refer to that homework and/or dataset for these questions.
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Retrieve the dataset in MATLAB using the IEEGToolbox and generate a \emph{session} variable as before (No need to report the output this time). What is the sampling rate of this data? What is the maximum frequency of the signal content that we can resolve? (2 pts)

%  \item The unit activity sample in \texttt{(I521\_A0001\_D001)} was high-pass filtered to remove low-frequency content. Assume that the seizure activity in \texttt{(I521\_A0001\_D002)} has not been high-pass filtered. Given that the power of a frequency band scales roughly as $1/f$, how might these differences in preprocessing contribute to the differences you noted in the previous question? (There is no need to get into specific calculations here. We just want general ideas.) (3 pts)

%  \item Two common methods of human iEEG are known as electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). For either of these paradigms (please indicate which you choose), find and report at least two of the following electrode characteristics: shape, material, size. Please note that exact numbers aren't required, and please cite any sources used. (3 pts)

% \section{Evoked Potentials (17 pts)} 
% The data in \texttt{I521\_A0001\_D003} contains an example of a very common type of experiment and neuronal signal, the evoked potential (EP). The data show the response of the whisker barrel cortex region of rat brain to an air puff stimulation of the whiskers. The \texttt{stim} channel shows the stimulation pattern, where the falling edge of the stimulus indicates the start of the air puff, and the rising edge indicates the end. The \texttt{ep} channel shows the corresponding evoked potential. 
% Once again, play around with the data on the IEEG Portal, in particular paying attention to the effects of stimulation on EPs. You should observe the data with window widths of 60 secs as well as 1 sec. Again, be sure to explore the signal gain to get a more accurate picture. Finally, get a sense for how long the trials are (a constant duration) and how long the entire set of stimuli and responses are.

% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Based on your observations, should we use all of the data or omit some of it? (There's no right answer, here, just make your case either way in a few sentences.) (2 pts)
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
%  \item Retrieve the \texttt{ep} and \texttt{stim} channel data in MATLAB. What is the average latency (in ms) of the peak response to the stimulus onset over all trials? (Assume stimuli occurs at exactly 1 second intervals)(3 pts)
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
%  \item In neuroscience, we often need to isolate a small neural signal buried under an appreciable amount of noise.  One technique to accomplish this is called the spike triggered average, sometimes called signal averaging. This technique assumes that the neural response to a repetitive stimulus is constant (or nearly so), while the noise fluctuates from trial to trial - therefore averaging the evoked response over many trials will isolate the signal and average out the noise.
%  Construct a spike triggered average plot for the data in \texttt{I521\_A0001\_D003}.  Plot the average EP in red.  Using the commands \texttt{hold on} and \texttt{hold off} as well as \texttt{errorbar} and \texttt{plot}, overlay error bars at each time point on the plot to indicate the standard deviation of the responses at any given time point.  Plot the standard deviation error bars in gray (RGB value: [0.7 0.7 0.7]). Make sure to give a proper legend along with your labels. (4 pts)

% <latex>
%  \item 
%   \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item We often want to get a sense for the amplitude of the noise in a single trial. Propose a method to do this (there are a few reasonably simple methods, so no need to get too complicated). Note: do not assume that the signal averaged EP is the ``true'' signal and just subtract it from that of each trial, because whatever method you propose should be able to work on the signal from a single trial or from the average of the trials.
