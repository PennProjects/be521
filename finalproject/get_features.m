    % Instructions: Write a function to calculate features.
    %               Please create 4 OR MORE different features for each channel.
    %               Some of these features can be of the same type (for example, 
    %               power in different frequency bands, etc) but you should
    %               have at least 2 different types of features as well
    %               (Such as frequency dependent, signal morphology, etc.)
    %               Feel free to use features you have seen before in this
    %               class, features that have been used in the literature
    %               for similar problems, or design your own!
    %
    % Input:    clean_data: (samples x channels)
    %           fs:         sampling frequency
    %
    % Output:   features:   (1 x (channels*features))
