% \section{Unit Activity (15 pts)} 
% The dataset \texttt{I521\_A0001\_D001} contains an example of multiunit human iEEG data recorded by Itzhak Fried and colleagues at UCLA using 40 micron platinum-iridium electrodes.
% Whenever you get new and potentially unfamiliar data, you should always play around with it: plot it, zoom in and out, look at the shape of individual items of interest (here, the spikes). The spikes here
% will be events appx. 5 ms in duration with amplitudes significantly greater than surrounding background signal.
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Using the time-series visualization functionality of the IEEG
%  Portal find a single time-window containing 4 spikes (use a window width
%  of 500 ms). The signal gain should be adjusted so that the spikes can be seen in entirety. Give a screenshot of the IEEG Portal containing the requested plot.  Remember to reference the LaTeX tutorial if you need help with how to do this in LaTeX. (2 pts)\\

%  \item Instantiate a new IEEGSession in MATLAB with the
%  \texttt{I521\_A0001\_D001} dataset into a reference variable called
%  \emph{session} (Hint: refer to the IEEGToolbox manual, class tutorial, or the built-in \emph{methods} commands in the \emph{IEEGSession} object - i.e., \emph{session.methods}). Print the output of \emph{session} here. (1 pt)\\

%  information by exploring the fields in the \emph{session} data structure
%  you generated above. Give your answer in Hz. (2 pts)\\

%  \item 
%  \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Using the \emph{session.data.getvalues} method retrieve the
%     data from the time-window you plotted in Q1.1 and re-plot this data
%     using MATLAB's plotting functionality. Note that the amplitude of the EEG signals from the portal is measured in units of $\mu V$ (microvolts), so label your y-axis accordingly. 
%     (NOTE: Always make sure to include the correct units and labels in your plots. This goes for the rest of this and all subsequent homeworks.). (3 pts)\\

% 	\item Write a short bit of code to detect the times of each spike peak
% 	(i.e., the time of the maximum spike amplitude) within your
% 	time-window. Plot an 'x' above each spike peak that you detected superimposed on the plot from Q1.5a. (Hint: find where the slope of the signal changes from positive to negative and the signal is also above threshold.) (4 pts)\\

%   learned about different methods to obtain and localize neural signals for BCIs.
%   Describe the naming convention for the International 10-20 system for EEG recording. In your own words, what do the
% 	letters refer to and what can you infer from the parity (even vs. odd)
% 	of the number at a given site? (1 pt)\\
